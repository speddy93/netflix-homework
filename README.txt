/*
    You have pool of resources that could be booked by people (owners).
    Every resource at any particular time could be reserved for one event only.
    Every owner at any particular time could hold reservation for one resource only.
    Assuming that reservation system should be implemented in memory and concurrently serve many requests at the same time.
    Please design your solution and implement ReservationSystem interface ensuring application consistency and good performance dealing with millions of events.
    In the same class please also implement ReservationSystem_Management interface to allow system configuration.
    
    Example: meeting room booking system in office building
